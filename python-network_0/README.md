# Python Network - Fetching URL Status

This script fetches the status of `https://alu-intranet.hbtn.io/status` using the `urllib` library.  
It reads and decodes the response body, displaying its type, raw content, and UTF-8 content.  
The script ensures proper resource management with a `with` statement.  
Make it executable with `chmod +x` and run it to see the output.
